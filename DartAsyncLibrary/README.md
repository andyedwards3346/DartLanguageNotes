# Dart Async Library
From dart:async Library Official Documentation

> Asynchronous programming often uses callback functions, but Dart provides alternatives: Future and Stream objects. A Future is like a promise for a result to be provided sometime in the future. A Stream is a way to get a sequence of values, such as events. Future, Stream, and more are in the dart:async library.

The dart:async library works in both web apps and command-line 
apps. To use it, import dart:async.
