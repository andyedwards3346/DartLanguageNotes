# Dart Convert Library
From dart:convert Library Official Documentation

> The dart:convert library has converters for JSON and UTF-8, as 
well as support for creating additional converters. JSON is a simple
text format for representing structured objects and collections. UTF-8
is a common variable-width encoding that can represent every character
in the Unicode character set. 

The dart:async library works in both web apps and command-line 
apps. To use it, import dart:convert.
