# Dart HTML Library
From dart:html Library Official Documentation

> Use the dart:html library to program the browser, manipulate objects and elements in the DOM, and access HTML5 APIs. DOM stands for Document Object Model, which describes the hierachy of an HTML page. 
> Other common use of dart:html are manipulating styles(CSS), getting data using HTTP requests, and exchanging data using WebSockets. HTML5 (and dart:html) has many additional APIs that this section doesn't cover. Only web apps can use dart:html, not command-line apps. 

Note: For a higher level approach to web app UIs, use a web framework such as AngularDart. 

To use the HTML library in your app, import dart:html.
